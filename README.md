# NewsTagger AI: News Article Classifier

## Overview

NewsTagger AI is a Streamlit-powered web application designed to classify news articles into predefined categories using various machine learning models. This project demonstrates an end-to-end natural language processing (NLP) classification pipeline, covering text preprocessing, feature extraction, model prediction, and interactive result visualization.

The application allows users to paste news article content, select different classification models, and receive immediate category predictions along with confidence scores and insights into feature importance. It also includes a feedback mechanism to help improve model performance over time.

## Features

* **Multi-Model Classification:** Choose from several pre-trained machine learning models (Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest, Logistic Regression) to classify articles.
* **Real-time Prediction:** Get instant category predictions for pasted news content.
* **Confidence Scores:** Understand the certainty of each model's prediction.
* **Influential Words Analysis:** Visualize the top words that influenced a model's classification.
* **Model Comparison:** Compare predictions and confidence levels across different selected models.
* **Interactive UI:** User-friendly interface built with Streamlit and custom CSS for a modern dark theme.
* **User Feedback System:** Provide feedback on predictions to help log and potentially improve model accuracy.
* **Analytics Dashboard:** View basic analytics on collected user feedback (Correct/Incorrect classifications, most corrected categories).
* **Model Information:** Detailed descriptions and performance metrics for each integrated model.
* **Category Explanations:** Understand the scope and definition of each classification category.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the NewsTagger AI application on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.8+
* `pip` (Python package installer)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository (or download the project files):**
    If you have Git:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url> # Replace <repository_url> with your actual repo URL if hosted
    cd NewsTagger-AI # Or whatever your project folder is named
    ```
    If you downloaded a ZIP, extract it and navigate into the project directory.

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3.  **Activate the virtual environment:**
    * On Windows:
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    * On macOS/Linux:
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

4.  **Install the required Python packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5.  **Obtain Pre-trained Models and Vectorizers:**
    This application requires pre-trained machine learning models (`.pkl` files for Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest, Logistic Regression), a TF-IDF vectorizer (`vectorizer.pkl`), a label encoder (`label_encoder.pkl`), and a `model_accuracies.json` file. These files are typically generated by a separate training script. **Ensure these files (`vectorizer.pkl`, `label_encoder.pkl`, `model_accuracies.json`, `model_naive_bayes.pkl`, `model_svm.pkl`, `model_random_forest.pkl`, `model_logistic_regression.pkl`) are present in the root directory of your project alongside `app.py`.**
    *(If you don't have these, you would need a `train.py` script to generate them from a dataset. This README assumes they are available.)*

### Running the Application

Once all prerequisites are met and models are in place:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
